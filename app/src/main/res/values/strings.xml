    <string name="dog_1_text">Cookie is sweet, though only with those she knows and loves, which takes some time! A fun and lovable little toughie. Since coming to the sanctuary, she has won the hearts of every person she has met, which is no surprise considering she is absolutely adorable!</string>
    <string name="dog_2_text">Snoopy is lean and lanky, elegant with a hounds barrel chest. She is sensitive and elegant - and fast! She can sit, shake, and lay down. She loves to chew on her bone and play with her Kong. She can be a bit nippy and territorial. She interacts and plays with our small dog just fine.</string>
    <string name="dog_3_text">Boopie is a fine fellow-he is very social, happy, affectionate and a tad goofy and silly. He will greet you with a big smile and with non-stop tail wagging.</string>
